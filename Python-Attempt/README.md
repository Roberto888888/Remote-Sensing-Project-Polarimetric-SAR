This is an attempt I made a few years later to complete the same project in Python but it didn't work.

NOTE: I didn't perform despeckling in this case.

NOTE: I used a different part of the dataset (specifically I compared data for March and May rather than March and April, but this doesn't change the substance that it doesn't work as it should...)
